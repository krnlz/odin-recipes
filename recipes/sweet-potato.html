        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These addictive seasoned "fries" from Mark Bittman are actually baked, but we promise you won't miss the grease. The spice mix – garlic powder, paprika, salt and black pepper – can be used on regular potatoes as well (you'll just need to increase the baking time a bit).</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika powder </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oven to 400.</li>
                <li>Cut the sweet potatoes into sticks ¼ to ½ inch wide and 3 inches long, and toss them with the oil.</li>
                <li>Mix the spices, salt and pepper in a small bowl, and toss them with the sweet potatoes. Spread them out on 2 rimmed baking sheets.</li>
                <li>Bake until brown and crisp on the bottom, about 15 minutes, then flip and cook until the other side is crisp, about 10 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
            </ol>
